    "##### Dictionaries \n",
    "A dictionary is a collection of key-value pairs; you can read more about them [here](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#dictionaries). An example dictionary is:\n",
    "```\n",
    "hogwarts_house_mapping = {\n",
    "    \"Harry Potter\": \"Gryffindor\", \n",
    "    \"Cedric Diggory\": \"Hufflepuff\", \n",
    "    \"Draco Malfoy\": \"Slytherin\", \n",
    "    \"Luna Lovegood\": \"Ravenclaw\"\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "You typically use dictionaries when there is a unique _key_ (the value left of the \":\"). In the example above, each Hogwarts student can only belong to one house. Hence, the dictionary is a good data structure to use. \n",
    "\n",
    "To lookup the value in a dictionary, i.e. to see which house a student belongs to, you would make this call:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "harry_house = hogwarts_house_mapping[\"Harry Potter\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This would return `Gryffindor`. \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if you tried to get Hermione's house:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hermione_house = hogwarts_house_mapping[\"Hermione Granger\"]\n",
    "```\n",
    "...you'd get a `KeyError`, as the key doesn't exist. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, you can either _handle_ the `KeyError` or add some defensive coding:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "hermione_house = hogwarts_house_mapping.get(\"Hermione Granger\", \"\")\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, if the key doesn't exist in the dictionary, you get an empty string (\"\") back. Sometimes, you'll want to handle the exception cleanly. Other times, the default value will suffice. \n",

    "When you're reading a CSV file into a `pandas` table (called a `dataframe`), you pass in a bunch of parameters. One of these is to infer the header. There are two ways of doing so:\n",
    "* If the CSV file has a header row (which is presumably the first row), then `header=0` will ensure your column headings are correct.* \n",
    "* If the CSV file doesn't have a header, then you can use `names=fieldnames` to assign column headings. This will depend on the `fieldnames` variable being defined (as it is above). \n",
